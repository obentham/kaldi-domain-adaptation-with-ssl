	make sure ssl_swbd is featurized!

	pseudo-label assigment occurs in local/chain/prepare_ssl_batch.sh

	ssl occurs in local/chain/run_tdnn_ssl.sh

	use ~/scripts/kaldi/egs/rm/s5/local/chain/tuning/run_tdnn_wsj_rm_1c.sh as a reference for ssl

	when using steps/chain/train.py, set
		--trainer.input-model
		--trainer.num-epochs


	consider
	1. using half of ssl_swbd for a lm
	2. using a scoring metric rather than random batching for ssl_swbd
	3. applying perturbation to ssl data
