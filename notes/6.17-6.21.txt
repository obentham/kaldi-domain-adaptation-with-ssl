TODO:	standardize all <SPOKEN_NOISE> to <unk>
		be aware of relative sample rate and bit rate between wsj and swbd
		featurize corpora (in s5_from_scratch/) --> feats.scp
		set up pytorch-kaldi config file
		during SSL, integrate batching with metric for candidate evaluation

Mon 6/17
	I think I fixed the error in lang and lm prep
	successfully got to the end of stage 3

Tue 6/18
	successfully got to the end of stage 4

	TODO:	confirm bit-rate and sample-rate
			featurize data

	audio info
		wsj
			sample rate		16k
			precision		16 bit
		swbd
			sample rate		8k
			precision		14 bit --> 16 bit via PCM

		use 'sox <in-file> -r 16k <out-file>' on swbd to fix

	may have fixed sample-rate issue. If error persists, reference:
		~/mnt_larocca2/2018_kaldi/koeln_german/s5/data/train/wav.scp

	wrote code to create subsets as well

Wed 6/19
	TODO:	fix sph2pipe | sox issue
			featurize data

	still working on sample-rate issue. Look at man sox for help

	finished kaldi code, running now. Begin work on pytorch-kaldi

Thu 6/20
	TODO:	get a test set and ssl set out of swbd
			clean up lang/lm/dict directories
			run mono/tri/chain training in kaldi to get cmvn and fmllr feats
			set up pytorch-kaldi config file

	created test and ssl set from swbd

	script ready to run, preprocessing finished, run using
		nohup ./run.sh --stage 7 >> run.log

Fri 6/21
	TODO:	when Adam finishes MT training, run command above
			use chain model to get alignments for all data
			remove s5 and replace with s5_from_scratch
			set up pytorch-kaldi config file

	currently training up to tri3b since it doesn't need GPU
	looking into utils/data/get_utt2dur.sh (tangential)

	Began doing morphology project to implement attention seq2seq.
	See local Documents/morphological-inflection-practice
