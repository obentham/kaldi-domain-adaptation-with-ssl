6/3-6/7
	mainly worked on lit review. Papers available on Mendeley.com

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon 6/10
	Looked into controlling LM. Will stick with default for now (trained on WSJ)
	Ran Kaldi through to WSJ tri4b

Tue 6/11
	Began s5_from_scratch/ to rewrite run.sh with full control over data
	Running chain model from s5/ mainly as a test for time
	Work on moving components over to s5_from_scratch/

Wed 6/12
	LM 		--> train from WSJ
	dict	--> train from WSJ and SWBD (avoid OOV because it isn't interesting)

	assumption for both of these is that they serve as a ground-truth (i.e. non-variable)

Thu 6/13
	TODO: 	featurize corpora (in s5_from_scratch/) --> feats.scp
			set up pytorch-kaldi config file
			during SSL, integrate batching with metric for candidate evaluation

	be careful with upper/lower case in transcriptions
		might be done --> all lower

	useful kaldi scripts:
		utils/subset_data_dir.sh
		utils/data/remove_dup_utts.sh


Fri 6/14
	TODO:	be aware of relative sample rate and bit rate between wsj and swbd
			standardize all <SPOKEN_NOISE> to <unk>
